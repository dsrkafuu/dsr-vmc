# DSRVMC Vanilla Modpack

Lightweight vanilla Minecraft modpack for DSRVMC project.

We recommend using [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports) mod to disable player chat reporting whenever possible. The mod is not included by default because it may prevent you from joining secure servers.

For players from China, check out [here](https://dsrkafuu.net/minecraft)(WIP) for more details.

## Details

Starts from Minecraft 1.4.7 in 2012, the modpack is for those who want to join vanilla servers without too much QoL features.

Performace improvement is the main goal.

It's also great for using as a base for your own large modpack, you can clone the GitHub repository and start from there.
